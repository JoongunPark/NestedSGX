	Intel(R) SGX is a set of CPU instructions that can be used by
	applications to set aside private regions of code and data.  The code
	outside the enclave is disallowed to access the memory inside the
	enclave by the CPU access control.

	The firmware uses PRMRR registers to reserve an area of physical memory
	called Enclave Page Cache (EPC). There is a hardware unit in the
	processor called Memory Encryption Engine. The MEE encrypts and decrypts
	the EPC pages as they enter and leave the processor package.
